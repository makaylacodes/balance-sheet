# Balance Sheet

This is a learning-based project on CSS pseudo selectors. 

 I learned how to properly change element styles and trigger events on the webpage in CSS by creating a balance sheet. This project is a part of a responsive web design series by FreeCodeCamp.

Visit the live site <a href="https://balance-sheet-css.netlify.app/">HERE</a> to view the hover effect. Simply drag your mouse over the total sections.
