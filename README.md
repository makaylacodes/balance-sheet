# Balance Sheet

This is a learning-based project. 

To learn pseudo selectors in CSS, I created a balance sheet. I learned how to change the style of an element and trigger other events on the webpage. This project is a part of a responsive web design series by FreeCodeCamp.

Visit the live site <a href="https://balance-sheet-css.netlify.app/">HERE</a> to view the hover effect. Simply drag your mouse over the total sections.
